### Project 3 Requirements/Deliverables
| Step  | √ | Requirement |
| Step | √ | Requirement |
| :---: | :---: | :--- 
| 01 |  | 15-minute data deep-dive or infrastructure walkthrough that shows
**machine learning** in the context of what we’ve already learned.
| 02 |  | Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to “smarten” the algorithm.
| 03 |  | Perform a deep dive of existing data using machine learning
| 04 |  | Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML.
(Use D3 or Plotly to change the visualization.)
| 05 |  | Create an idea with mock data that simulates how machine learning might be used.
| 06 |  | Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
| 07 |  | You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library
| 08 |  | Must use 2 of pandas, matplotlib, SQL database, Tableau, d3, plotlyJS, Bootstrap

### Notes from Dan 2020-05-12:
* Make an app, not a model
* Use ML as an analysis tool - show trends over time
* If you tell people a rate/week, the accuracy of your model becomes highly correlated with your grade
* You guys should productionalize a model that's in the RMSE of 0.007 and you'll be good. Don't try to go higher
* If you guys get an okay model in 2 hours, go with that
