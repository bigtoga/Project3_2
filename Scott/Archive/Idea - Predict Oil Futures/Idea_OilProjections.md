<summary>Timeline of current crisis</summary>

### Multiple timelines
1. Normal Winter oil consumption in the US
2. Coronavirus begins and how oil prices slumped 
3. Russia walking out of OPEC meetings which caused Saudia Arabia to lower prices but increase production

<summary>Crude oil classifications</summary>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(crude_oil)

### Notes FTA [Crude oil classifications](https://www.thebalance.com/the-basics-of-crude-oil-classification-1182570):
- Many types of crude oil
- Naming is mix of location ("West Texas...") and/or characteristics  (sweet, sour, light, heavy)

Sweet and Sour
- Crude oil with low sulfur content is classified as “sweet.” 
- Crude oil with a higher sulfur content is classified as “sour.” 
- Sulfur content is considered an undesirable characteristic for both processing and end-product quality. 
Therefore, **sweet crude is typically more desirable and valuable than sour crude**. 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is a good example of sweet crude oil, while oil from Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast tends to be sour.

Light and Heavy
- oil’s relative density, based on the American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity
- Light is inexpensive to produce 
- Heavy crude can’t be produced, transported, and refined by conventional methods

Crude oil futures have a few classifications:
**Light Sweet Crude Oil** is the most popular grade of crude oil being traded because it 
is the easiest to distill into other products and it is traded 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 

**Brent Blend Crude** is a grade of oil that is primarily traded in 
London and seeing increased interest. Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
States are the world's three largest oil producers as of 2018.
**Brent is the most widely used benchmark for determining gasoline prices.**

<summary>Possible questions we could answer</summary>

# Possible Questions we could answer
## Historical analysis
* Has there been an impact on [Big Oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Oil) valuations as crude oil dropped?
* Which companies are the most/least impacted by crude oil drop?
* How have Americans' 401k plans been impacted - by crude oil drop? By Big Oil value loss?
* What happened in the markets in 1957 before and after the last time oil went negative?
* What were the leading indicators? How could a savvy investor have predicted this?
* What does global politics have to do with this price (Russia vs. Saudi's Arabia)?
* * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russia%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_oil_price_war
* What impact has oil collapse had on the strength of the US dollar?
* What impact has this had on  Saudi Arabia's cash reserves? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/saudi-central-bank-fx-reserves-plunge-27-billion-in-march

## COVID-19 Related
1. What impact did COVID-19 have on already distressed prices?

## Predicting the future (AI/ML)
1. Do we expect a return to normalcy in Winter as more Americans will likely be at home and require heating 
from oil than likely ever before in history?
2. Do we expect the price of oil to be impacted by re-opening the country?
3. What impact would a second wave of covid-19 have on future oil after a rebound?
4. Are certain parts of the country more important to an oil rebound than others?
5. If COVID-19 never happened, would oil still have gone negative?

## Other tie-ins that might be interesting to explore (aka distractions)
1. Has the demand for solar decreased as oil prices have slumped?

* * Money quotes FTA:
* * * "Based on an analysis of more than 100 days of real data so far this year, the IEA’s Global Energy Review includes estimates for how energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions trends are likely to evolve over the rest of 2020."
* * * "This is a historic shock to the entire energy world. Amid today’s unparalleled health and economic crises, the plunge in demand for nearly all major fuels is staggering, especially for coal, oil and gas. Only renewables are holding up during the previously unheard-of slump in electricity use,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. “It is still too early to determine the longer-term impacts, but the energy industry that emerges from this crisis will be significantly different from the one that came before.”
* * * "The report projects that energy demand will fall 6% in 2020 – seven times the decline after the 2008 global financial crisis. In absolute terms, the decline is unprecedented – the equivalent of losing the entire energy demand of India, the world’s third largest energy consumer. "
* * * "... global energy-related CO2 emissions are set to fall by almost 8% in 2020, reaching their lowest level since 2010. This would be the largest decrease in emissions ever recorded"
